HOW songs are stored within 


Tasks left to do:
    - add case for user that doesn't have playlists
    - make usable for other users, in main.py, lines 14-18
    - figure out how to play random song on website
        - figure out how to start and stop song
        - attach button to starting and stopping
        - attach button to play song in intervals, ie for one second, four seconds.
    - Fix UI 
        - After logging in, a rotating wheel with all playlist covers which the user can scroll through, below said playlists, is a menu where they may select which "game mode", they wish to play.
        - Above looks something like this, https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1152756493872021534/1310401985870172180/image.png?ex=67451673&is=6743c4f3&hm=46b737f20886e7ce67a2e7f2ac8234406e5269e78a5018e8f39546e947b7e161&
    - Implement game modes
        - First, establish game rules, the technicality of how long a song is played, how many guesses a user gets persong, how many rounds of the game are played in a single game, as well as possibly different "power-ups" that the user can use?
        - Streak system, figure out how to tell if the user has logged into and played the game multiple days in a row, and keep track and somehow display the count.
        - Edge cases of songs  
            - Songs that have silence in their first seconds, meaning that the user couldn't possibly guess the song since it's just silence
                - Check the waveforms of the song possibly?
            - Songs that the user has added to a playlist but has yet to listen to
            - Songs that we guess that the user "doesn't remember", ie songs that the user hasn't listened to in over a year, or songs that have very "dull" openings
                - Similar to silence, maybe check variety of waveforms of songs? Ie, if a songs is just a single unchanging tone for the first 4 seconds, don't put it in the game as the user may be annoyed, when their clues are just the same
            - Songs that give bad clues
                - Ie, songs that have no variety within the first 12 seconds, for example the user would listen to the first 1 second of the song, guess, then every second they listen to after that would be the exact same, they would gain no new information to make a guess on the song. 
    - Testing
        - Will also require website hosting.

    - search bar for playlists, IE a user has too many playlists, don't want to scroll through 40 million playlists.

2025 NOTES:

Make usable for multiple users
Play the song
Stop the song
Track time that the song has played 
Playing the right version of the song (finding waveform of the song)
Allow user to guess song, checks if song is right, if incorrect play the next ‘gate’ of time’ 
Touch up user interface (ASSUREDLY)
Create mock up user interface
Implement User interface based off of mockup
Add a judging system for songs
Evaluation of suitableness of song based off of first 16 seconds
Songs that have little variations within the first 16 seconds
Songs that are silence for the first x amount of seconds
Songs a user has added to a playlist but has not listened to. 
Weighting on random selection algorithm
Prevent repeated song selections
Weight towards known songs? (preferably not some random shit that has literally 3 views)
